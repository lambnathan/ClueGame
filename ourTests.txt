To make checking the legend's symbols fail in testRooms(), we checked a room against another room's symbol.
This should only be correct if we assign symbols wrong when reading the BoardRooms file.

To get failing tests for the board dimensions, we set the constants of rows and columns equal to wrong numbers.

The first four cells that FourDoorDirections() tests are all cells that do not have doors on them. 
The next cell is a Conservatory that has a door that opens DOWN, and we test if it is NOT a doorway.
The last cell that we test is a Conservatory with a door that opens RIGHT, and we test if the door direction
is LEFT.

When checking if the rooms and the cell's symbols from the board are correct and match what's in the legend,
we make the method fail by testing against other room's symbols.
